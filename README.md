# FEJava
  FEJava is a tile based combat strategy game based off the Fire Emblem series, though I hope to make it more unique by adding my own unique storylines, changes to combat, and other mechanics.
  Also this is my first major project, hence the bad README and probably bad code.

# Motivation
  This is a side project made in my spare time to help me expand my knowledge and give me something hopefully impressive to put on my university application, and to possibly later use on my resume for coop. It may also be used for my grade 12 CS summative project.
  
# Build Status
  
  
# Code Style
  
  
# Tech Used
  Coded using Netbeans, but probably doesn't require it (I haven't checked yet).
  
# Installation
  
# Credits
  Everything is done by me, including code, art, story, etc. The general concept is based off of Fire Emblem.
